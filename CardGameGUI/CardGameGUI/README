How the project runs:

	=> From package "client", the class MyTestClient instantiates both GameEngineImpl and GameEngineImplGUI classes
	before passing them inside the contructor of GameEngineCallbackGUI class, which is the entry point of all UI code.
	Note that this class is now also added as a callback alongwith the previous GameEngineCallbackImpl.
	
	=> From GameEngineCallbackGUI, GameFrame is instantiated and all other view classes also instantiated and added to
	the frame. Rest of the gameplay starts when the Add Player button is first clicked. Appropriate comments are there to 
	show the flow.
	
	=> Almost every view class, after being instantiated in the gameFrame, is then passed via constructors to other view
	classes as deemed necessary.


Potential problems that are not solved:

	1. After two players are added and deal is finished for the first player, the cards will show
		on the cardPanel nicely. But they sort of fluctuate and get repainted twice, like an up and down
		phenomena. Also, when the other player is switched from the comboBox, who hasn't dealt, the previous
		player's cards do not disappear from the panel - this is the problem. However, the switchable panel
		does function partially, in the sense that, after the second player is finished dealing, when the 
		first player is again clicked, his cards do reappear on the panel. Same thing will happen for the 
		second player and the house now that all have dealt.

	2. The fontsize is hardcoded, i.e. the card labels do not get scaled properly when the panel is stretched.
	
	3. If user enters integer in an input dialog box that is expecting string, the program runs into exception,
	but the entry will successfully NOT be recorded and user will be notified accordingly.
